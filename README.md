# knight-tour
This code generates the path required for a knight's tour  around a chessboard with user-specified dimensions
During each step of the tour, the algorithm will find all of the next valid moves, and recursively run self.tour() with updated n (count)
this  project will show you the dimenshion of chess board of 8x8 grid and direct you the knight tourb on board.
we use pygame hear to implement knight tour using python
